Our goal is not to replace CART (Communication Access Real-time Translation) or Interpreters. Instead, we are aiming to provide a reliable, no-cost tool to make events more accessible where there would otherwise be nothing. Unfortunately, there isn't always enough budget to meet the needs of all your attendees. This project is an effort to make events more accessible in the face of the financial barrier.
